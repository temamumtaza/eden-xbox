## Progress

The release owner has reported one Xbox Series S smoke test in which *Wild West Crops* ran. That
single test does not establish broad game compatibility; the table below records separate Xbox
Series X test results.

### Games

Tested only with dumps of games the tester owns, on a retail Xbox Series X in Developer Mode with
the app in Game mode. Frame rates are for areas whose shaders are already compiled: the first visit
to a new area still stutters while its shaders build.

| Game | Xbox Series X | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! | **60 FPS**, stable | No graphical errors |
| Mario Strikers: Battle League | **60 FPS** in matches, stable (same on PC) | No graphical errors, Hyper Strike cutscenes included |
| Super Mario Bros. Wonder | **55–60 FPS**, stable | No crashes or graphical errors |
| The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom | Still hits the app's memory limit | On PC it reaches the open world at **30 FPS**, after fixes to vertex fetching and to manual derivatives that broke the first cave |

Audio works without problems in every game above. None of them has been played from start to
finish, so none is called "fully playable" yet.

### Subsystems

| Part | How it is done here | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Renderer | Own D3D12 backend, modelled on Eden's Vulkan backend | Feature level 11.0, shader model 6.4, no Agility SDK on the console |
| Guest shaders | Eden's recompiler emits SPIR-V, Mesa's `spirv_to_dxil` turns it into DXIL, `dxil.dll` signs it | Guest shaders cached on disk per game and rebuilt in parallel at boot; integer textures lowered to texel fetches |
| CPU | Dynarmic JIT with W^X inside the AppContainer, plus a per-game profile that compiles known code before the game starts | See [The JIT warm-up](#the-jit-warm-up) |
| Guest memory | Placeholder memory through the `*FromApp` APIs, committed on demand | The app has 5120 MiB in Game mode; renderer caches shrink with it, see [The memory guard](#the-memory-guard) |
| Textures | ASTC decoded on the GPU into BC3 (default since 0.2.59) | CPU path kept as `astc=bc3` |
| Audio | XAudio2 2.9 | Same path on PC and Series |
| Front end | Game library with cover art, in-game menu, configuration panel | Imports keys and firmware from a folder; games from `LocalState\games` or external folders |
| Input | Xbox controllers, keyboard on PC | Emulated controller type and per-game language |
| Recovery | A GPU failure returns to the library instead of killing the app | Still being validated on the Series |

## Architecture

The app is one UWP executable. The same package runs on a Windows PC, which is where every change is
tried before it goes to the console.

Where things live:

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/eden_uwp/` | Front end: CoreWindow boot, library, in-game menu, controllers, file import, `eden_uwp_diag.txt` |
| `src/video_core/renderer_d3d12/` | The D3D12 renderer: scheduler, buffer and texture caches, pipelines, root signatures, presentation (see [Inside the renderer](#inside-the-renderer)) |
| `src/shader_recompiler/` | Eden's shader recompiler, with the adjustments the D3D12 profile needs |
| `tools/xbox/mesa/` | Our additions to Mesa's `spirv_to_dxil` (pipeline linking, integer sampling) |
| `tools/xbox/` | Build, packaging, local run and Mesa build scripts |
| `dist/uwp/` | App manifest and package assets |

Two runtime DLLs are loaded from the package root: `spirv_to_dxil.dll` (built from Mesa by
`tools/xbox/build-spirv-to-dxil.ps1`) and `dxil.dll` (from the Windows SDK). If either is missing,
the renderer falls back to presenting the guest framebuffer through the CPU.

### Inside the renderer

`renderer_d3d12` follows the layout of Eden's Vulkan backend. The generic `TextureCache`,
`BufferCache`, `ShaderCache` and `FenceManager` templates, the Vulkan `StateTracker` and
`FixedPipelineState` are shared; the D3D12 part supplies their runtimes. Each file has one job:

| Area | Files | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device and submission | `d3d12_device`, `d3d12_scheduler`, `d3d12_fence_manager`, `d3d12_query_cache` | Device, direct queue, command lists and allocators, GPU ticks, deferred releases, guest fences and queries |
| Presentation | `renderer_d3d12`, `d3d12_present_manager`, `d3d12_swapchain`, `d3d12_present_blit`, `d3d12_present_cpu`, `d3d12_overlay` | Composites each frame into a frame of its own; a dedicated thread copies it to the swapchain and presents (see below) |
| Draws | `d3d12_rasterizer*`, `d3d12_accelerate_dma`, `d3d12_maxwell_to_d3d12`, `d3d12_graphics_pipeline`, `d3d12_compute_pipeline`, `d3d12_root_signature` | Draw state, clears, indirect draws, DMA, PSOs and their root arguments |
| Shaders | `d3d12_pipeline_cache`, `d3d12_shader_compiler`, `d3d12_linked_shader_cache` | SPIR-V → DXIL translation on worker threads, the per-game disk cache of guest pipelines, reuse of linked shaders |
| Textures | `d3d12_texture_cache`, `d3d12_image_*`, `d3d12_depth_stencil_transfer`, `d3d12_astc_gpu_decoder`, `d3d12_sampler`, `d3d12_framebuffer`, `d3d12_texture_formats` | Images, views, uploads and downloads, copies and blits, ASTC on the GPU |
| Helper shaders | `d3d12_blit_image`, `d3d12_blit_compute` | Blits, masked clears, depth-stencil packing, ASTC decode and BC3 encode |
| Memory | `d3d12_buffer_cache`, `d3d12_staging_buffer_pool`, `d3d12_transfer_buffer_pool`, `d3d12_resource_allocator`, `d3d12_memory_guard` | Buffers, the upload ring, reused GPU scratch buffers, placed texture heaps, the memory guard |
| Binding | `d3d12_descriptor_heap`, `d3d12_barrier_batch`, `d3d12_pipeline_helper`, `d3d12_resource_utils` | Descriptor ring and sampler heap, batched barriers, helpers shared by draws and dispatches |
| Diagnostics | `diagnostics/` | Draw trace, frame dumps, performance report, pipeline and ASTC checks; kept off the hot paths |

**Presentation.** The GPU thread composites each frame into one of three textures of its own and
submits it. A separate thread (`D3D12Present`) waits on the swapchain's frame latency waitable object,
copies the frame into the back buffer and presents it, so the GPU thread never waits for the display.
Both threads submit to the same queue under one lock, because `Present` and `ExecuteCommandLists`
racing on two threads can deadlock. Without a waitable swapchain, or with `async_present=0` in
`boot.cfg`, presentation runs on the GPU thread as before.

### The JIT warm-up

**The problem.** Dynarmic translates Switch ARM64 code to x64 the first time each block runs. On a
PC that cost hides well, but inside the Xbox sandbox every compile also has to flip the code pages
between writable and executable (W^X is mandatory in the AppContainer), and the console's CPU cores
are slower. So the first minutes of a game, and every new area, were full of small freezes that had
nothing to do with the GPU.

**What this fork does.** It remembers which code a game runs and compiles it before the game starts:

1. While you play, each emulated CPU core records the blocks it compiles: guest address, length and
   a hash of the ARM64 instructions. No host machine code is stored.
2. On exit the list is saved per game, per core and per executable build
   (`LocalState\eden\cache\jit-profile\<title-id>\core-N.bin`), written to a temporary file and
   renamed, so a crash never leaves a half-written profile.
3. On the next launch, before the guest runs, the cores replay their profiles in parallel, each with
   its own JIT and a budget of about 115 MiB of emitted code. The loading screen shows the progress.
4. Learning continues during play, so each session adds what the previous one missed.

**Why it is safe.** A profile is only a hint. Before a block is compiled from it, the block must sit
in executable, non-writable memory that the game loaded, and its instructions must match the stored
hash and length. A profile for another game, another update of the game or another core, or one
with a bad checksum, is discarded and the core simply learns again. A block that fails these checks
is compiled the normal way when the game reaches it. W^X and the normal invalidation of modified
code stay in place, and the warm-up never runs guest code or changes guest state.

**The result.** On PC the preload time fell by about half. It is on by default; `jit_prewarm=0` in
`boot.cfg` turns it off and `jit_prewarm=record` only learns, without the warm-up.

How this compares: Ryujinx's PPTC caches translated host code on disk; this profile stores only
*what* to compile and recompiles it each launch. That costs boot time, but nothing executable is
ever read back from disk.

### The memory guard

**The problem.** In Game mode the whole app gets a hard limit of 5120 MiB, and on the Series the
GPU shares that same memory. Past the limit, the system refuses new commits
(`CreateCommittedResource` returns `E_OUTOFMEMORY`). An app left over the limit is suspended after
two seconds. A PC emulator assumes it can grow its caches while there is room. A fixed cache size
does not work either: what fits in a 2D game is too much in an open world.

**What this fork does.** Once per frame the GPU thread measures two things: the app's commit
against its limit (`Windows.System.MemoryManager.AppMemoryUsage`, the same figure the system's
Resource Manager enforces) and the GPU's usage against its DXGI budget. It keeps a pressure level
for each, takes the worse one, and every optional consumer of memory adapts to it:

| Free memory in the app | Level | What gives way |
| --- | --- | --- |
| More than 512 MiB | Normal | Nothing; textures are evicted at the usual pace |
| 512 MiB or less | Pressure | Texture garbage collection runs more often and evicts more per frame |
| 256 MiB or less | Critical | A second, deeper eviction pass |
| 128 MiB or less | Emergency | Maximum eviction; the linked shader cache is emptied; upload ring cut to 128 MiB |
| 64 MiB or less | — | Upload ring cut to 64 MiB; eviction is no longer rate-limited |
| 32 MiB or less | Last resort | The GPU is drained and the upload ring is released entirely |

The GPU budget has its own thresholds at 80, 90 and 97 % of its size.

Between two measurements, allocations are checked too. Each new upload or readback buffer is
subtracted from the last measured headroom. When that estimate nears a 64 MiB reserve, the guard
measures again. If the buffer would cross the reserve, it first gives memory back: retired buffers
are freed, work already submitted to the GPU is waited for, and a buffer it releases is reused
instead of creating a new one. If the system still refuses a commit (a staging buffer or a
texture), the same reclamation runs and the allocation is retried once.

**Why it is built this way.**
- **Hysteresis.** Each level is entered at one threshold and left only at a higher one (for
  example, Emergency is entered at 128 MiB free and left at 192 MiB). The caches do not flap
  between sizes every frame.
- **No stalls in the normal case.** Ordinary reclamation never waits for the GPU. Near the reserve
  it waits only for work already submitted, at most once per command list, and never splits a draw
  being recorded. Only the last resort drains the GPU.
- **Nothing in use is freed.** Buffers still referenced by submitted GPU work, and readbacks the
  emulator is waiting on, are kept until their fence passes.
- **It recovers, one step at a time.** The upload ring grows back from 0 to 64, 128 and 256 MiB.
  Each step needs its new size plus 256 MiB free for 120 frames in a row. If a shrink follows a
  growth, the next growth needs twice as long (up to two minutes), so a game living near the limit
  settles instead of oscillating. The linked shader cache comes back after ten seconds with
  768 MiB free. A failed ring allocation is retried 120 frames later, not every frame.
- **Little waste in upload buffers.** Large ones are sized in sixteenths of a power of two, so
  they commit less than 12.5 % more than requested. A 17 MiB upload takes 18 MiB, where it used to
  take 32.
- **The texture cache never plans for the whole limit.** Its budget is the smaller of the DXGI
  budget and the app limit minus 1.5 GiB, which is left for the emulated Switch's own memory.
- **Tested in isolation.** Every threshold and transition lives in
  `src/video_core/renderer_d3d12/d3d12_memory_guard.h`, which has no device dependency, and is
  checked by `tools/xbox/tests/memory-guard.cpp`.

Guest memory is handled separately: it is reserved up front and committed only when the game
touches it, so a game that maps a large heap does not use real memory for the parts it never
writes.

### The bug tracker

**The problem.** The first run of Mario Strikers: Battle League turned up a series of bugs. About
thirty pipelines were rejected for sampling integer textures, geometry shaders wrote to streams,
the GPU hung, an nvmap assert fired and the movie player aborted. Each had to be dug out of
`eden_log.txt`. That was hard for three reasons:
- Unsupported features are reported only once per process, or not at all (unsupported texture
  formats, for example).
- Lost draws are never counted.
- Every `UNIMPLEMENTED` ends up mixed into the general log.

**What this fork does.** The tracker deduplicates and counts these bugs and writes them to two
files of their own in `LocalState\eden\log\`:
- `eden_graphics_bugs.log` holds one line per bug the first time it appears. Each line gives the
  time, frame, category, source location and context (shader hashes, format, HRESULT). A table
  with the counts follows at exit.
- `eden_graphics_bugs.json` is the same summary for scripts. For each bug it lists hits, first and
  last frame, the first message, and per-detail counts (one per format, shader pair or HRESULT).

It covers:
- the renderer: dropped draws and dispatches, rejected pipelines, shader recompilation and DXIL
  failures, ignored state, formats with no DXGI equivalent, skipped copies and blits, failed API
  calls, device removal, and NaN/Inf in trace mode;
- the GPU engines, nvdrv and nvmap;
- guest panics;
- every `UNIMPLEMENTED`, `ASSERT`, `UNREACHABLE` and logged stub in the emulator, at its real
  source location.

Warnings reach the tracker even when `log_filter` hides them. `bug_tracker=0` in `boot.cfg`
turns the tracker off. To get the files off a console, use the Device Portal file explorer
(LocalAppData → the package → LocalState → eden → log).

**Why it is built this way.**
- **Close to free.** Each call site owns its counters, held in static storage. A repeated hit of a
  known bug costs a few relaxed loads and stores: no locked instruction, no call, no allocation, and
  the message arguments are not evaluated. Measured: about 1 ns per hit, and 0.3 ns when the
  tracker is off.
- **Messages are formatted once per bug.** That happens in a cold, out-of-line function, which hands
  the message to a bounded lock-free queue and never blocks.
- **No file I/O on emulator threads.** A writer thread at the lowest priority appends the lines
  about once a second. It rewrites the JSON at most every ten seconds, and only when a count
  changed. A device removal, guest panic or game exit flushes at once.
- **Crash safe.** The crash handlers append the lines still queued, using plain C stdio without
  locks.
- **Reported once.** A log that sits next to a tracked site is muted for the tracker, so the same
  bug does not appear twice.
- **Tested in isolation.** `tools/xbox/tests/bug-tracker.cpp` covers deduplication, concurrency, the
  queue, classification, the files end to end, and the cost.

## Running it on a console

Requirements: an Xbox Series X|S in Developer Mode, the package you built (see
[Building](#building)), and your own `prod.keys`, `title.keys`, firmware and games.

1. Open the Device Portal at `https://<console-ip>:11443`.
2. Install `eden-xbox.appx` together with its `Microsoft.VCLibs.x64.14.00.appx` dependency.
3. In the app's settings on the console, set it to **Game** mode. Otherwise the memory limit is much
   lower than the 5120 MiB the emulator expects.
4. Start the app. In the configuration panel, import keys and firmware from a folder.
5. Add games: copy them to the app's `LocalState\games` folder with the Device Portal file explorer,
   or add an external folder from the library.

If something fails, `eden_uwp_diag.txt` (in `LocalState`) and `eden\log\eden_log.txt` describe what
happened. The diagnostic switches are listed in [docs/xbox/xbox_deploy.md](docs/xbox/xbox_deploy.md).

## Building

Windows, Visual Studio 2022 with the UWP workload, and the Windows SDK. Run from PowerShell or
`cmd`, not from Git Bash.

```powershell
# Mesa's spirv_to_dxil, once (and whenever tools\xbox\mesa changes)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\xbox\build-spirv-to-dxil.ps1

# Configure and build the app
tools\xbox\build-env.bat cmake --preset uwp-x64
tools\xbox\build-env.bat cmake --build --preset uwp-x64 --target eden-uwp

# Package for the console (build-uwp\package\eden-xbox.appx)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\xbox\package-appx.ps1 -Library

# Or build, register and launch it on this PC
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\xbox\local-run.ps1 -Library
```

## Documentation

The port is documented in [docs/xbox/](docs/xbox/README.md) (in Spanish): design of the D3D12
backend, the shader pipeline, performance measurements, memory, audio, the front end, and the
console test logs, including what went wrong and why.
